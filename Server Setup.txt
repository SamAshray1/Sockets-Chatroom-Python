Server Setup
Import Libraries:
    socket
    threading

Initialize Server Socket:

    Create a socket using socket.socket().
    Bind to a host and port using socket.bind((host, port)).
    Start listening for connections using socket.listen().

Handle Client Connections:

    Accept new connections using socket.accept().
    Start a new thread for each connected client to handle communication.

Broadcast Messages:

    Implement a method to send received messages to all connected clients except the sender.
    
Run the Server:

    Continuously accept and handle new client connections.

Client Setup
Import Libraries:

    socket
    threading

Initialize Client Socket:

    Create a socket using socket.socket().
    Connect to the server using socket.connect((host, port)).

Handle Sending Messages:

    Implement a function to send messages to the server.
    Start a thread to handle user input and send messages.

Handle Receiving Messages:

    Implement a function to receive messages from the server.
    Start a thread to continuously listen for incoming messages and display them.
    Additional Considerations
    Error Handling: Implement proper error handling for network failures and disconnections.
    User Interface: Consider adding a simple command-line or graphical interface for better user experience.
    Security: Implement basic security measures like input validation and encryption if necessary.
